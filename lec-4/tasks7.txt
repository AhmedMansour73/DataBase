Create a table customers with a full_name column. Insert names with extra spaces at the beginning and/or end.

Write a query to remove both leading and trailing spaces from the names using TRIM.

Display only the names with leading spaces removed using LTRIM.

Display only the names with trailing spaces removed using RTRIM.

Trim specific characters (e.g., $, *, or #) from both sides of a given string.

4. Oracle Conditional Expressions – CASE Expressions
Create a students table with name and score columns. Insert at least 5 records.

Write a query using CASE to assign grades based on the score:

90 and above: A

80–89: B

70–79: C

Below 70: F

Modify the query to display “Pass” if score is 60 or more, otherwise “Fail”.

Use CASE to display a message for each student:

"Excellent" for A, "Good" for B, "Average" for C, and "Needs Improvement" for F.

Write a CASE expression using system date to return the name of the day (e.g., “Today is Monday”).

5. Oracle Conditional Expressions – DECODE Function
Use DECODE to return grade letters ('A', 'B', 'C', 'F') based on specific score values (e.g., 100 = A, 90 = B, etc.).

Create a status_log table with a status_code column containing values like ‘N’, ‘I’, ‘C’.

Use DECODE to convert:

‘N’ → ‘New’

‘I’ → ‘In Progress’

‘C’ → ‘Completed’

Use DECODE to check if a product’s quantity is 0, and display “Out of Stock”, otherwise “Available”.

Write a query using DECODE to display a bonus:

If department is ‘HR’ → 500

If department is ‘IT’ → 1000

If department is ‘Sales’ → 1500
